The global path planning for the coverage region is defined as the path taken by the robot from a start position Ps(x, y) to an exit position Pe(x, y) while passing through all accessible places and avoiding obstacles. To get this global path, partition it into mini-paths, the latter of which must not exceed the sensor's range, as shown in Fig. 4.1.\\
